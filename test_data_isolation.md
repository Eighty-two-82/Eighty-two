# Data Isolation Issue Fix Testing Guide

## Problem Description
Data mixing issue you encountered: Data from e appears in b, data from abc also appears in def.

## Root Causes
1. **Missing permission validation on API endpoints**: Key methods like `getAllPatients()` and `getAllTasks()` did not filter data by user permissions
2. **Missing user identity headers in frontend**: Frontend did not send `X-User-Id` and `X-Organization-Id` headers
3. **Incomplete data access control**: Missing data isolation based on user roles and organization IDs

## Fixes Applied

### Backend Fixes
1. **PatientController.getAllPatients()** - Added permission validation and data filtering
2. **TaskController.getAllTasks()** - Added permission validation and data filtering  
3. **PatientController.getPatientById()** - Added permission check
4. **TaskController.getTasksByPatient()** - Added permission check

### Frontend Fixes
1. **api.js** - Added request interceptor to automatically send `X-User-Id` and `X-Organization-Id` headers
2. **userService.js** - Save `organizationId` to sessionStorage on login

## Permission Control Logic

### User Role Permissions
- **Admin**: Can access all data
- **POA/FM**: Can only access patient data they are associated with
- **MANAGER/WORKER**: Can only access patient data they are authorized to access

### Data Isolation Mechanisms
1. **Patient data isolation**: Based on user roles and authorization relationships
2. **Task data isolation**: Based on patient access permissions
3. **Organization data isolation**: Through `organizationId` field

## Testing Steps

### 1. Restart Backend Service
```bash
cd backend
mvn spring-boot:run
```

### 2. Restart Frontend Service
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

### 3. Test Data Isolation
1. Log in as abc role, view patient and task data
2. Log in as def role, view patient and task data
3. Verify data is no longer mixed

### 4. Verify Permission Control
1. Try to access other users' data
2. Verify 403 permission denied error is returned
3. Confirm only authorized data is visible

## Expected Results
- abc role can only see abc-related data
- def role can only see def-related data
- Data is completely isolated between different organizations/users
- Appropriate error messages are returned when access is unauthorized

## Notes
- Ensure all users have correct `organizationId` and `userType` settings
- Ensure authorization relationships (Authorization table) are correctly configured
- If issues persist, check user and organization ID configurations in the database
